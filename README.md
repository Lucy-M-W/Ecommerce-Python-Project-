# Ecommerce-Python-Project
Ecommerce Python Project in Jupyter Notebook
In this project, I analyzed an online store dataset to uncover trends and answer key business questions. The dataset was cleaned and processed using Python, and the analysis was performed to provide actionable insights. The results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook, along with visualizations to support the findings.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about an online store's sales, including:

- Product details: Product categories, prices, costs, and profit margins.

- Sales data: Order dates, regions, shipping details, and return statuses.

- Customer information: Shipping modes and order priorities.

The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency before analysis.


## Questions Explored
The following questions were addressed during the analysis:

1. Which products have the highest profit margin compared to other product categories?

2. Which region has the highest sales?

3. Which month has the highest sales?

4. Do orders with same-day shipping have the lowest rate of returned products?

5. Is the company's profit more on weekdays than on weekends?
